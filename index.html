            <p>
                Hello! My name is Zach Draper, I am 33 years old. I have 2 kid, an 11 year old daughter and a 4 year old
                son.
                They are my life, everything that i do in my life now is for them, including finding a better way to make
                money
                to support them.

                I am currently in the University of Utah Coding bootcamp, and am extremely excited to go on this
                journey. I already have a little background in the industry, I recieved an assosiates degree in computer
                programming from
                Eagle Gate College. Although that was 10 years ago, and i never kept coding or looking for a job. I regret
                it now, and am
                ready to get back into, and stick with it this time.


                A few things that i enjoy doing for fun spending time with my kids is the most imoportant thing to me. I
                also enjoy
                spending time with my friends. I enjoy anything to do with being outside, wether it is fishing, hiking,
                camping, or
                writing code. I really enjoy the challenges to building websites, and see a bright future in the industry.
